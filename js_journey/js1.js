// ";" it is use for a good practice use it but not necceseary to use it "js is to forgiving languge so no problem"

console.log("hello") // use for print somthing on screen 

 const id = 288393 // its a keyword after use of this you naver change any thing in this it means a constant
 let email = "naveen8989@google.com"  // use it every where , you want 
 var password = "23333" // now we did'nt use it if you want to know more about then search it 
  account_city = "shimla" // it is a another way its taken as a wronng practice so did'nt use it 
   
// id = 2 //not  allowed 
console.log(id);

; // its like a table use it your self 

// prefer not to use var 
// becuz of issue in block scope and function scope 

let account_state; // the vale is undifined in js if you did'nt assign any thing to variable it taken as a undifined value 
console.table(id,email,password, account_city);
